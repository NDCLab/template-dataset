### Instructions
**If pulling data from a public repository**

Copy (via a script) the repository directly here, in the exact same format, naming conventions and folder structure as it appears in the public folder from which it was copied.  Delete the "raw" and "checked" subfolders. Include the script used to copy the data in the `code/` folder of this repository.

**If collecting new data**

Data will be placed in the "raw" and "checked" subfolders provided.

**Note:** This folder is explicitly untracked in this repo's .gitignore file because data files are too large to be stored on GitHub.
